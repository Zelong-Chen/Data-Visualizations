# AdventureWorks

- Examined the business request from a sales manager from AdventureWorks to generate an executive sales report of the company’s internet sales. Identify the necessary data source from the company’s data warehouse on Microsoft SQL Server, then clean/extract data through SQL queries. Import extracted data into Power BI to create interactive dashboards through Power BI that effectively communicate business insights that was specified from the sales manager.
